# tpiosrpbot
Here is a bot for QQ chatbot programmed by 望村小居士(TPIOS), which is based on None-Bot

### Requirements

I'm programming in **Python 3.7** with **none-bot==1.3.0**

You may use

```
pip3 install none-bot==1.3.0
```

to install the none-bot

Meanwhile, you should also download CoolQ Air or CoolQ Pro to establish your QQ-bot.
